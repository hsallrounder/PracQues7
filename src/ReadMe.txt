Q1. The Olympic results are given in a table, where each row represents a country,
and columns represent gold, silver, and bronze medals.
For example, the element r[0][0] is the number of gold medals earned by the 0-th country.
Write a method that takes the table as an input, and returns a new array which lists the total number of medals for each country.
For example, if we start with the table
     2   0   1
     3   2   0
     0   0   2
in which the 0-th country earned 2 + 0 + 1 = 3 medals, the 1-st country earned 3 + 2 + 0 = 5 medals,
and the 2nd country earned 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 medals, your method should return an array with values
   3
   5
   2



Q2. The 2022 Commonwealth Games, officially known as the XXII Commonwealth Games
and commonly known as Birmingham 2022 are about to start.
To help sports commentators determine in real time how countries are doing, the list of gold medals won
by each country was originally saved in an array of countries and an array of medals separately.
To simplify implementation, information has to be transferred from the existing arrays into a linked list.
Write a Java method to transfer country and gold medal data from the arrays into a linked list with all elements in the same order



Q3. Write a recursive method for computing the sum of all the elements of an array. Start with an algorithm in English,
then translate this algorithm into code. Trace your method on the example of the following array with 3 elements: 2, 0, and 1.



Q4. Print an array that contains the exact same number as the given array, but rearrange so that all the even numbers
come before all the odd numbers. Other than that, the numbers can be in any order.
You may modify and print the given array, or make a new array.

Rearrange ([3,3,2]) -> [2,3,3]
Rearrange(0,1,0,1,1,]) -> [0,0,1,1,1]



Q5. Enter a string from user and store each character of a string in different nodes of a linked list and print the values

Input :  neeraj

Output :  n -> e -> e -> r -> a -> j
